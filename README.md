# TeTra

## TEmperature TRAcker. Today everyone is involved in both appraising or bashing 'tracing apps'. Instead we will track your temperature.

How ? We plan to track your temperature only when you agree and in situations were you are aware of the tracking attempts. We will no use at all your personal data and so on.  How is this possible ? Try to imagine a situation where you wear a bracelet or another wearable device that CAN measure wyour temperature. You don't want to have your temperature measured ? Take it off! The chip to transmit the data have a very small range so, YOU have to go willingly nearby a collecting device. 

Some technical keyword: NFC, Linux, Python, Orm, Cloud.
