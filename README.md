# TeTra

## TEmperature TRAcker. Today everyone is involved in both appraising or bashing 'tracing apps'. Instead we will track your temperature.

How ? We plan to track your temperature only when you agree and in situations were you are aware of the tracking attempts. We will no use at all your personal data and so on.  How is this possible ? Try to imagine a situation where you wear a bracelet or another wearable device that CAN measure wyour temperature. You don't want to have your temperature measured ? Take it off! The chip to transmit the data have a very small range so, YOU have to go willingly nearby a collecting device. 

Some technical keyword: NFC, Linux, Python, Orm, Cloud. 

### workflow:

We plan to develop a simple wearable circuit, able to read body temperature and, to communicate to nearby reader via NFC. We qualify our project for and hardware donation and we use it for test. The gift is a nrf52840-DK from Nordic. 

We have used this board to create a temperature reader and to communicate answering to an NFC inquiry. 

The collected data are processed and inserted in a local database. After the data are sent to central dabase that stores the temperatures and make it available for elaborations and predictions realized by third party. 

Keyord: Python, Orm, sqllite, mysql

### project parts: 

devices: hereby we have stored software and documents related to temperature reading, hardware simulations and other small things. 


system: hereby we have stored software related to local and general data storage. 

### detailed workflow:


### example of use:
